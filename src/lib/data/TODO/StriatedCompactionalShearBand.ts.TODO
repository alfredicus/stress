/**
* Striated Compactional Shear Band 

Striated Compactional Shear Bands are neoformed planar structures observed specifically in granular porous rocks such as sandstones.
Their formation is linked with grain-breakage processes in the Cap of the yield strength envelope.

The plane of movement of a Striated Compactional Shear Band is defined by two perpendicular vectors:
The normal to the plane and the striation.

Striated Compactional Shear Bands are defined in the input file as a striated plane.
Optional parameters concerning the friction angle interval or the <Sigma 1,n> angular interval may be specified.

We make the following hypotheses concerning principal stress orientations: 
a) The compressional axis Sigma 1 is located in the plane of movement:
    Its direction is inside the extensional quadrant and may be constrained by optional parameters (<Sigma 1,n> minimum and maximum)
b) The extensional axis Sigma 3 is located in the plane of movement:
    Its direction is inside the compressional quadrant and may be constrained by optional parameters (<Sigma 1,n> minimum and maximum)
c) The intermediate axis Sigma 2 is located in the fault plane and is perpendicular to the striation.

Let Sm be the principal reference system for the stress tensor (Sigma 1, Sigma 3, Sigma 2)m obtained from the Striated Compactional Shear Band
    i.e., the three stress axes satisfy the previous hypotheses.

Several data sets defining neoformed striated planes are considered:
1) Case 1: The optional parameters concerning the <Sigma 1,n> angular interval are not specified
    In such case, the location of the striated plane in the Mohr Circle is not constrained and includes all the left quadrant of the Circle.
    In other words, angle <Sigma 1,n> is in interval (0,PI/4]

3) Case 3: The minimum and/or maximum <Sigma 1,n> angular interval are defined in interval (0,PI/4]

The geometry and kinematics of the Striated Compactional Shear Band are defined:
a) Each plane is defined by a set of 3 parameters, as follows:
    Fault strike: clockwise angle measured from the North direction [0, 360)
    Fault dip: [0, 90]
    Dip direction: (N, E, S, W) or a combination of two directions (NE, SE, SW, NW).
b) The sense of mouvement is indicated for each fault plane:
    For verification purposes, it is recommended to indicate both the dip-slip and strike-slip compoenents, when possible. 
      Dip-slip component:
          N = Normal fault, 
          I = Inverse fault or thrust
      Strike-slip component:
          RL = Right-Lateral fault
          LL = Left-Lateral fault
      Undefined (the most compatible type of movement is selected **): 
        UND
    Sense of mouvement: N, I, RL, LL, N-RL, N-LL, I-RL, I-LL, UND
