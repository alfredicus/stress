Each fault is defined by a set of parameters as follows:
        The fault plane orientation is defined by three parameters:
        Fault strike: clockwise angle measured from the North direction [0, 360)
        Strike direction (optional): (N, E, S, W) or a combination of two direction (NE, SE, SW, NW).
        Fault dip: [0, 90]
        Dip direction: (N, E, S, W) or a combination of two directions (NE, SE, SW, NW).

Optional information on fault plane:

curved fault plane
length (mm, m dm)


The striation is defined in two possible ways (which are exclusive):
1 -   Rake (or pitch) [0,90], measured from the Azimuth alpha (alpha points in one of the two directions of the fault strike)
        Azimuth alpha direction: (N, E, S, W) or a combination of two directions (NE, SE, SW, NW)
        Rake direction: (N, E, S, W) or a combination of two directions (NE, SE, SW, NW).
2 -   For shallow-dipping planes:
        Striae trend: [0, 360)

Sense of mouvement: Normal, Reverse, Right-Lateral, Left-Lateral, or a combination of two.

The type of striation can be indicated (optional parameter):
Fully striated plane
Ploughing elements
Crystallized material linked to iiregularities in the fault surface (e.g. calcite)
        Calcite fibers

Secondary fractures:
        T criteria
            Tensile fractures
            Crescentic fractures

        R Criteria
            Riedel shears
            Lunate fractures

        P criteria

dissolution
Reactivated (phase 2)
Curved striation
Tensile fractures
R' : high angle antithetic secondary shears
